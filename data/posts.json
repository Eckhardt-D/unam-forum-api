It will take place from 27 – 29 August 2019, at Safari Hotel, Windhoek. The conference is appropriately themed “The Role of Quality Assurance Systems in Enhancing Higher Education Outcomes in Namibia”.\nThe Conference is a joint partnership between the National Council for Higher Education (NCHE), Namibia Qualifications Authority (NQA) and various tertiary institutions in the country.\nUNAM’s Director for Quality Assurance, Dr Ngepathimo Kadhila, remarked that “Such a conference has been long overdue and I look forward to sharing our UNAM specific experiences while at the same time learning from what others have done”.\nHe further added that Quality has received increasing importance as the landscape of higher education experienced significant changes, some which are: increased international competition, increasing demands of value for money, modern technologies that have entered the classroom, thus modifying the nature of the interactions between students and professors, etc. These changes in the higher education landscape require new methods of assuring and enhancing quality, but there has not been a major review done on the quality assurance practices in Namibia.\n“You cannot use old tools to solve new challenges in today’s business”, he explained passionately. Further mentioning how quality lacks a clear definition, and how complex measuring quality is in a higher education context, “When a lecturer has taught, and the student claims to have studied, yet the result is poor, who is to blame? Do we put more pressure on lecturers to teach better, or do we demand that students work harder?”\n“The State and the students also demand that the learning experience be worth their money”, he added. These are fundamental issues that we need to interrogate and answer if we wish for the higher education system to live up to its purpose of enhancing the quality of student learning experiences”. “We need to come to a common understanding as a nation and choose the most reliable means to enhance and assess quality”, remarked Dr Kadhila.\nTargeted participants are ministries, senior government officials, the heads and management teams of QA agencies, leaders of universities and staff, practitioners’ in quality assurance, agencies in HE institutions, researchers and academicians, professional bodies and civil society, Unions and industry representatives, as well as development partners.\nFor conference registration or enquiries please visit: http://www.naqahec.edu.na\n\t",

It has 768 CPU cores with 1.5 Terabyte of RAM and 384 Gigabyte of storage. The newly received HPC rack, code-named the “Stampede” comes with a total of 640 CPU cores, 1.2 Terabyte of RAM and 10 Terabyte of storage. The Stampede HPC rack will be set-up and configured in the near future, effectively doubling available computing resources.\nThe Supercomputers are hosted by the Department of Physics in UNAM’s Faculty of Science building, but also cater for interdisciplinary computational research needs beyond astrophysics. Since its inception in 2017, the Ranger HPC rack has been used for various projects like the “Land Degradation Assessment Baseline report: Omusati Region” by the Department of Geography, History and Environmental Studies Geo-Information Science (GIS) unit in conjunction with GIZ and the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry.\n\nIn the Department of Physics, PhD and MSc projects on modelling the broadband emission of globular clusters and analyses of gamma-ray data of active galactic nuclei, recorded with the H.E.S.S. telescopes, are conducted. The Ranger HPC rack has also been used by masters and honours students in the School of Computing, undertaking final year projects which require greater computational power than an average laptop or desktop computer. The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry is in the process of migrating some of the computation that the department is currently running on CHPC’s Lengau cluster to the UNAM HPC cluster.\nTo date, the Ranger HPC rack has run close to 500 jobs by more than 50 active users.\nThe Faculty of Science plans to host various trainings and workshops geared towards creating awareness in HPC.

    "full_text": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\tDrought stricken Namibia no longer has to dream about the prospect of drinking affordable sea water. This comes barely a month after the launch of a solar-powered desalination plant at UNAM’s coastal campus, the Sam Nujoma Campus, which has successfully piloted water purification by making sea water fit for human consumption.\nSpeaking during a visit with stakeholders this week, the Founding Father of the Namibian Nation, His Excellency, Dr Sam Nujoma made an emphatic to plea to government to prioritize investing in desalination plants as an alternative to the over-reliance on underground water.\n\n“I would therefore like to propose to the Government of the Republic of Namibia to adopt Seawater Desalination using renewable energy as the principal source of bulk water supply in our country in medium and long term time frames”, urged Dr Nujoma.\nHe further justified his claim by explaining how a report from UNDP shows that water scarcity affects more than 40 percent of people around the world. It is an alarming figure that is projected to increase with the rise of global temperatures, as a result of climate change.\nThe plant at Henties Bay is unique, because it is fully operated by solar power. “It clearly demonstrates that Namibia can utilize its unlimited seawater resources and tap from its abundant solar energy to guarantee the supply of clean water to its entire population”, highlighted Dr Nujoma.\n\nThe Technology behind it\nUNAM’s Pro-Vice Chancellor for Research, Innovation and Development, Professor Frank Kavishe, explained the science behind the new desalination plant, which was made possible by a partnership between UNAM and the University of Turku in Finland.\n“This plant is the first of its kind in the world because it uses reverse osmosis technology to desalinate seawater based entirely on solar energy”, remarked Professor Kavishe.\nHe further explained how solar energy is captured from an array of solar photovoltaic panels and transmitted directly into the containerized desalination plant, to power the high pressure pump necessary for the inlet raw water and the operation of the high pressure reverse osmosis membranes.\nRaw seawater is pumped from the ocean and transported through a set of filters to remove sand and any solids from the water. The filtered seawater is then forced through the reverse osmosis membranes to produce clean desalinated water that is pumped overhead storage tanks. The concentrated salt solution known as brine is a by-product that is removed from the plant through drainage pipes and sent back to the ocean. In future, this brine will be sent to a salt recovery plant to produce salt.\nThe current plant is a pilot project that produces about 3000 litres per hour. This is not enough to address current water shortages in the country. To produce enough water for transportation in land, as far as Windhoek, would require significant investment. One which can produce at least 30 million cubic meters of desalinated water per year. Transportation of the water in-land, from the coastal areas to the centre of the country, would require that water is pumped to an elevation of 1700 metres, and the requisite pipelines to get it there.\nProf Kavishe further highlighted that given Namibia’s long coastline, several plants would be needed to supply the whole country. One plant between Swakopmund and Henties Bay. Another between the mouth of the Kunene River, and one at Lüderitz.\nUNAM has a pre-feasibility report titled “Large- Scale Seawater Desalination in Namibia”.\n\t",

    "full_text": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\tAlumni of German Universities met at UNAM recently under the theme “Joining Hands for Sustainable Progress”. One of the key outcomes of the meeting was the establishment of a new alumni association, called the Association of Namibian-German Alumni (ANGA).\nANGA will serve as a platform to network, interact and engage with anyone in Namibia who received German funding for their education or research.\nAt the official opening, UNAM Vice Chancellor Prof Kenneth Matengu, delivered his welcoming remarks in which he narrated the parable of African children holding hands, while running in a competition all in the spirit of Ubuntu.\nWith this analogy, Prof Matengu conveyed the vision of the DAAD Alumni of joining hands for sustainable progress in Namibia and connecting with fellow Alumni worldwide.\n\nThe outgoing German Ambassador, Christian Schlaga, in his remarks outlined that annually, 130 Namibians are funded by DAAD and urged the Namibian alumni to join the global alumni network, as there are countless benefits like co-operation with highly skilled experts in any part of the world.\nSpeaking at the same occasion, UNAM Pro-Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, Prof Frednard Gideon, himself a DAAD Alumnus, outlined his personal relationship with DAAD. Being a DAAD scholarship holder for his Honours, enabled him to pursue his academic career to Masters and PhD level and eventually afforded another opportunity for DAAD funding during his postdoctoral studies.\nAfter these insightful and inspiring speeches, as well as personal stories related to DAAD, renowned economist, lecturer and consultant, Mr Mally Likukela, presented an academic talk on the country’s economic wellbeing. In this very interesting and interactive presentation, Mr Likukela outlined economic principles explaining the current economic situation. His talk was followed by a presentation from Ms Jennilee Kohima (DAAD Alumna) and Ms Barbara Liebel (DAAD Representative), who gave an overview on the Status Quo of the activities of DAAD Alumni in Namibia and the expected outcome of the meeting. Thereafter, the group attended an evening reception with Mrs Ellen Gölz, the German Deputy Head of Mission.\n\n\t",

    "full_text": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\tMarika Matengu, a teacher by profession, has served in various developmental projects in Namibia and is currently working as a lecturer at the Khomasdal Campus and a doctoral scholar at the University of Oulu, Finland.\nAs the first semester of 2019 is coming to an end at the Khomasdal campus, she is also wrapping up her office in preparation for relocating back to Finland this month.\nThis is her story.\nTwo and a half years ago, I joined a dynamic team of teacher educators at the University of Namibia, Khomasdal campus, which is situated in the suburb of Khomasdal, Windhoek, in a previously marginalized area. With this campus the University was brought closer to the community of Northwest Windhoek. It is centrally located, just within walking distance from the Medical campus, and other medical facilities.\nAccording to the Assistant Pro-Vice Chancellor, Dr. Amaambo, the campus is known as “the beacon of hope for many aspirant teachers and educators” who have interest in early childhood and primary education.\nThree different educational programmes are hosted by the Khomasdal Campus: the Diploma in Junior Primary Education, Honours Degree in Junior Primary Education and Honours Degree in Upper Primary Education. There are also students with disabilities and from marginalized/ ethnic communities to whom specialized services are provided. The high number of students makes the teacher training programmes some of the biggest programmes of the University.\nFeature Pic: Cultural and linguistic diversity is celebrated at Khomasdal campus (left to the right). Ms. Marika Matengu, lecturer, Dr. Amaambo, Assistant Pro-Vice Chancellor, Ms. Richardine Poulton-Busler, lecturer\n \nHands-on activities and practical classes are an important part of teacher training. In this picture, student teachers prepare teaching aids from self-made play dough for their indigenous story telling sessions.\nCurrently, Khomasdal campus has been training teachers as part of the University of Namibia for nine years. During these years, several changes in the field of education have taken place: free education system has been expanded, pre-primary education has been made as part of the public education system, education act and various policies tackling educational inequality have been put in place, curriculum has been revised and emphasis placed on learner-centered approach and importance of play in early learning.\nThese are great successes and important milestones in reaching the most vulnerable children. However, many challenges remain. The high number of student teachers make it challenging to provide transformational teacher training that equips students with strong theoretical and practical skills of education.\nRegardless of the challenges, there are many exciting developments at the Khomasdal campus. International experiences and expose have played an important role in bringing innovative and fresh ideas to the teacher training programme. Mr. Gustaf who is a music lecturer and Mr. Andre who is a drama lecturer, are just two of the teacher trainers who have graduated recently with their Master’s in Education from the University of Eastern Finland. Both of them acknowledge that the Finnish teacher training has given them a strong foundation to teach at Khomasdal.\nTeacher training in Khomasdal serves a unique community of Namibians. Its programmes are interwoven to the culturally and linguistically rich environment for which the campus has been training teachers for years. As part of the University, lecturers are now involved in the international collaboration, research and material development through which the educational needs of the nation can be met.

With this campus the University was brought closer to the community of Northwest Windhoek. It is centrally located, just within walking distance from the Medical campus, and other medical facilities.</p>\n<p>According to the Assistant Pro-Vice Chancellor, Dr. Amaambo, the campus is known as &#x201C;the beacon of hope for many aspirant teachers and educators&#x201D; who have interest in early childhood and primary education.</p>\n<p>Three different educational programmes are hosted by the Khomasdal Campus: the Diploma in Junior Primary Education, Honours Degree in Junior Primary Education and Honours Degree in Upper Primary Education. There are also students with disabilities and from marginalized/ ethnic communities to whom specialized services are provided. The high number of students makes the teacher training programmes some of the biggest programmes of the University.</p>\n<p><strong>Feature Pic:</strong> Cultural and linguistic diversity is celebrated at Khomasdal campus (left to the right).

In this picture, student teachers prepare teaching aids from self-made play dough for their indigenous story telling sessions.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Currently, Khomasdal campus has been training teachers as part of the University of Namibia for nine years. During these years, several changes in the field of education have taken place: free education system has been expanded, pre-primary education has been made as part of the public education system, education act and various policies tackling educational inequality have been put in place, curriculum has been revised and emphasis placed on learner-centered approach and importance of play in early learning.</p>\n<p>These are great successes and important milestones in reaching the most vulnerable children. However, many challenges remain. The high number of student teachers make it challenging to provide transformational teacher training that equips students with strong theoretical and practical skills of education.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the challenges, there are many exciting developments at the Khomasdal campus. International experiences and expose have played an important role in bringing innovative and fresh ideas to the teacher training programme. Mr. Gustaf who is a music lecturer and Mr. Andre who is a drama lecturer, are just two of the teacher trainers who have graduated recently with their Master&#x2019;s in Education from the University of Eastern Finland. Both of them acknowledge that the Finnish teacher training has given them a strong foundation to teach at Khomasdal.</p>\n<p>Teacher training in Khomasdal serves a unique community of Namibians. Its programmes are interwoven to the culturally and linguistically rich environment for which the campus has been training teachers for years. As part of the University, lecturers are now involved in the international collaboration, research and material development through which the educational needs of the nation can be met. Early childhood and pre-primary education is certainly at the core of the future directions. Teachers play a vital role in national building. One can say that teacher is a maker of man. He is the foundation of all Education, and thus the whole civilization of mankind, present and future. This is certainly true, in any given country or context.</p>\n\t"

The clinic also has great potential for research opportunities, including gathering data on disease and parasite status of the animals.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1169\" src=\"http://forumonline.unam.edu.na/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1D-Mobile-Clinic-300x200.jpg\" alt width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"http://forumonline.unam.edu.na/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1D-Mobile-Clinic-300x200.jpg 300w, http://forumonline.unam.edu.na/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1D-Mobile-Clinic-768x512.jpg 768w, http://forumonline.unam.edu.na/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1D-Mobile-Clinic-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://forumonline.unam.edu.na/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1D-Mobile-Clinic-720x480.jpg 720w, http://forumonline.unam.edu.na/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1D-Mobile-Clinic-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></p>\n<p>The mobile clinic is fully registered with the Namibian Veterinary Council, and complies with minimum standards for a surgical facility as prescribed by legislation.</p>\n<p>The current routes followed by the clinic are as follows, concentrating in low income communities with little or no access to veterinary services:</p>\n<p>South West: Bethani, Aus, Luderitz</p>\n<p>South East: Keetmanshoop, Grunau, Karasburg</p>\n<p>West: Karabib, Usakos, Uis</p>\n<p>East: Omitara, Witvlei, Drimiopsis</p>\n<p>North West: Kamanjab, Khorixas, Outjo</p>\n<p>North East: Rundu, Katima</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Written by: Dr. A.

By moving beyond theory to the realm of “learning by doing,’ the students got a first-hand experience of practicing what has been taught in class. The pair, who experienced practical exposure of two hours per week on rotating days, experienced the clinical placement site as a utopia for palliative care, especially in terms of the integration of Ethos of palliative care, which served as the basis for their placement at the facility. This opportunity allowed the students to practically learn about holistic care and the importance of palliative care for patients diagnosed with life-limiting and life-threatening illnesses.\nThe students’ academic supervisor, Dr Rachel Freeman, emphasised that “there is a lot of added value in the Work Integrated Education teaching and learning method as it enhances students’ academic outcomes beyond the classroom in an effort to prepare them competently for the world of work”.\nBoth students said they were impressed by the clear rules and regulations of NOC and by how each staff member, whether an oncologist or cleaner, plays an integral part in the daily operation of the facility. The multi-disciplinary team approach impressed them so much that they described it as, “a jigsaw puzzle”, whereby if one aspect of care is not there, then there is no total care of the person”.\nThe Namibian Oncology Centre (NOC) is based in Windhoek, and is a strategic partner of the University of Namibia.\n\t",

    "full_text": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\tThe Namibia Project Management (PM) Summit will bring together various project management community members on 7 June 2019.\nOver twenty experts in project management will deliver sessions on a broad range of topics from project management innovation, to project management office performance. According to Professor Grafton Whyte, Namibia Business School Director, “Anyone involved in project management in Namibia should not miss this event.”\nThe theme of the PM Summit is “Pursuing Peak Performance.” There are two tracks during the PM Summit: one for project managers in general and one for staff of current or future PMOs.\nThe Project Manager track includes sessions for seasoned project managers, as well as those who would like to enter the project management field. A session on project management certifications gives an overview of certification options and the pathway to attain them. Another session introduces agile project management methodologies, a trend that is gaining momentum in Namibia. There are several more sessions designed to equip attendees with knowledge needed to improve project performance.\nAccording to research recently published by Namibia Business School, Namibia has very few project management offices (PMOs) – a trend that is very different from the rest of the world. The Namibia PM Summit hopes to change this fact. Nerago Ndoroma (PMP) one of the PMO experts speaking at the Summit, explained that, “A PMO is charged with standardising project management practices within the organisation and in doing so increases the likelihood of project success.” The PM Summit educates organisations that want to start and sustain a successful PMO. The PMOs in Namibia research was conducted by Katrina Simon-Agolory (PMP) and Ndilimeke Shityeni over a year and a half, in 2017 and 2018. “The sessions in the PMO track are very practical. Attendees will leave with a better idea of how to start or improve their PMO,” Ndilimeke shared.\nInterested attendees may register for the PM Summit at any Pick-n-Pay store or online at www.webtickets.com.na. For additional information about the PM Summit, please contact via email (pmdiploma@nbs.edu.na) or WhatsApp (081 425 4593).\n\n\t",

Based in the Geography Department at the University of Namibia, Dr Persendt has been at Aberystwyth since November 2018 and Dr Hamunyela since January of this year.\nAt Aberystwyth they are being mentored by Professor Chris Thomas in the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences, working with Professor Stephen Tooth, Professor Andrew Thomas and Dr Andrew Hardy in the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences.\nIn addition to developing collaborative research ideas, the team is working to explore the links between malaria risk and hydrological and geomorphological processes in the ‘wetlands-in-drylands’ of northern Namibia.\nDr Persendt said: “These habitats form vector breeding habitats that needed to be identified and eradicated to enable Namibia to scale up its malaria control intervention programme that is entering the elimination phase.”\nDr Persendt and Dr Hamunyela have been exploring the application of remote sensing technology – both satellite based and unmanned aerial vehicles such as low-cost drones – to identify these habitats at very high spatial and temporal resolutions.\nDr Hamunyela said: “Together with scientists from the Aberystwyth University, we are exploring new ideas to develop scientific research proposals to conduct challenge-led disciplinary and interdisciplinary research with a special focus at the interface of global change and One Health.” Aberystwyth University and the University of Namibia are looking to develop collaborative research projects in areas such as remote sensing, forage crops, veterinary diseases and marine resources.\nProfessor Chris Thomas, Pro Vice-Chancellor for Research, Knowledge Exchange and Innovation, said: “The Rutherford Fellowship scheme has been a great success here at Aberystwyth and hosting Frans and Eliakim as our final two Rutherford Fellows, will not only lead to exciting collaborative research proposals, but has also greatly enhanced the development of our new strategic institutional partnership with the University of Namibia (UNAM). The timing has been ideal as it has also tied in very well with the work of CIDRA, our new Centre for International Development Research at Aberystwyth, and we look forward to developing future collaborative research projects with UNAM.”\nAberystwyth University has been awarded five fellowships under the Rutherford Fund Strategic Partner Grants scheme administered by Universities UK International (UUKi).\nDuring 2018 Dr Benjamin van der Waal from Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa, and Drs Peyton Lisenby and Paul Harvey from Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, spent time working at Aberystwyth University.\nThe short-term fellowships are funded by the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) through the Rutherford Fund, with the aim of attracting global talent and strengthening the UK’s research base.\nAberystwyth is one of only 24 universities in the UK to be selected for the prestigious research fellowships.\nArticle by Arthur Dafis\n\t",

Under the leadership of their Educational Technologies Lecturer, Sadrag Panduleni Shihomeka, who has extensive experience in teaching and researching educational media and technologies, they visited various organisations.\nThe organisations are in different sectors such as: mining, education, port management, community development/engagement, and so on. Organisations visited for a duration ranging from 2-4 hours were: NAMPORT Walvis Bay, NIMT (Arandis), COSDEC and COSDEF (Swakopmund), Rossing Uranium Mine (Arandis), Rossing Foundation (Swakopmund) and the Desalination Plant, some 35 kilometres from Swakopmund en route to Henties Bay.\nAt these organisations, students were inducted to various activities taking place at these organisations and how they make use of appropriate technologies to produce or offer their products or services. Some of the interesting media and technologies that they came across during this eye opening trip, are: the use of breathalyzers, biometric systems, radio, TV, CCTV, video/teleconferencing facilities, e-learning software (Master Math), two-way radios, BRT, sign and billboards, reverse osmosis membranes, social media: WhatsApp and Facebook.\nAccording to George Kaliteke, one of the students, the excursion was “an overwhelming experience but very impactful in the sense that, these organisations are more digitized than my pre-conceived misconceptions”\n“I recommend other students to have the same tour like us, so that they will be able to link theory to practice” narrates another student, Elizabeth Nghidishange.\n\t",

With a renewed sense of confidence and passion to help children. She worked hard. Unable to rely on a sharp memory, she made extensive notes, something she never used to do. Preparation for tests and assignments always began weeks before, not days. “The inspiration from those children, and my hard work is what got me here”.\nOn graduation day, last week Thursday in Keetmanshoop, a teary eyed Shannen walked off the stage into the embrace of her supportive family.

The highly motivated and dedicated Gabriel Taapopi Secondary School matriculant is shooting for the stars in terms of his desired career path and recent participation in a study abroad programme in Sweden early this year. Career Connect had an online chat with the level-headed and humble Shikongo to gain more insight into his experiences in Sweden.\n\nWhat inspired you to get into nursing?\nIt’s actually quite an incredible story. During my matric year at Gabriel Taapopi Secondary School in Ongwediva, I never contemplated joining such a profession. I was initially targeting to become an Engineer as I felt that I was very talented with drawing, designing and numerous other handy works. But, strangely enough, I never resolved to apply for it. Although engineering was a firm favourite, nursing was always much closer to my heart. I became more motivated to join nursing when I took my father to Oshakati State Hospital in 2015. The nurses treated him badly and they took very long to attend to him, which did not sit well with me. I then resolved to apply for nursing in the hope of one-day becoming a model nurse and thereafter resumed my studies at UNAM’s Oshakati campus, the following year in 2016.\nTell us more about this programme  \nThe Linnaeus-Palme student exchange programme is established for the sole purpose of facilitating interactions between students of the School of Nursing within the Faculty of Health Sciences at UNAM and the University West in Sweden.  I was selected along with Martha Mwandingi from Oshakati campus for the programme, due to both our stellar academic performances. Obviously, I could not refuse such a wonderful opportunity and I quickly accepted my nomination. I haven’t regretted it one bit.\nTell us more about University West and what the programme entailed\nMwandingi and I are currently doing internships at different hospitals in Sweden, such as NÁL Hospital, Trollháttan Stad, Vanesborg and Uddevalla. The main objective is to see how nursing is being practiced here, compared to our home country, Namibia. University West is the ideal place to study, because it offers students like me fresh perspectives. University West has agreements with universities all over the world through different bilateral agreements and welcomes around 200 exchange students each year. It’s an amazing institution. The only downside is that it is located in one of the coldest countries in the world, temperatures here can get as low as -2 or -5 degrees Celsius!\nLastly, would you encourage other students to take advantage of international internships and attachments and why?\nOf course yes! I wish for all students to get such an amazing opportunity. This is the best platform for further knowledge accumulation for students. Exchanging knowledge with other students and healthcare-related professionals from different countries has proved to be highly valuable to me and quite mind-opening. Study abroad programmes are not only great opportunities to learn, but also to have fun and make new friends and acquaintances.\n\t",

He specialized in Gender and Development Studies.\n\nIntrigued by his larger than life story, UNAM Forum asked John to narrate his journey.\nMy academic journey began in 2004, when I was admitted into the University of Namibia to pursue the Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and Sociology. I had just completed my grade 12 at Gabriel Taapopi Senior Secondary School, in Ongwediva.\nSince I was the second student with visual impairment to ever enroll at UNAM, the first few months were difficult. The University was not equipped with all the teaching aids for students with special needs. I had trouble just moving around, let alone finding sufficient material that I could read. However, with the support from the Department of Special Education, particularly Dr. Cynthy Haihambo and Dr. Mostert, I adapted and gradually picked up.\nDespite multiple challenges along the way, I vowed to never give up on my academic dreams. I knew that inclusive education is around the corner and preferred that its arrival would find me hobbling forward and not sitting by idly.\nInstead, to make it through the degree, I had to make use of tape recorders and cassettes to capture every lecture. By the end of every semester I would have accumulated a whole box of cassettes that often doubled by the end of the year. What’s more, I had to endure the cumbersome exercise of having to listen through all these cassettes to prepare for exams.\nI envied other students as they spoke of summaries, and short notes, a luxury I could not afford.\nIn 2006, whilst in my 3rd year, things changed for the better. The University established the Disability Unit with the assistance of Volunteers from Canada (VSO). The unit was soon equipped with computers with speech software, internet and Braille transcribers. That was a turning point in my woes. I was happy inclusive education finally arrived. As a consequence, the last two years of my study were less challenging compared to the first two.\nIn 2008, I graduated with the Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and Sociology.\nAfter a few years in the corporate industry, I resolved to get a higher qualification, knowing full well that more challenges lay ahead. So, in 2014, I enrolled for the Master of Arts in Gender and Development Studies, at UNAM.\nThe Master’s programme required extensive reading – a challenge for students with visual impairment. I recall tough presentations and the proverbial research project. However, with self-belief, passion and the will to succeed, I completed the course and am set to graduate in April this year.\nI feel that my performance could have been better, but passing well, is not the real aim of education, learning should be the reason we actually seek an education. I am glad to say that I have learned a lot, about the subject, and about myself.\nI am humbled to have become the first student with visual impairment to attain the Master’s Degree from UNAM and equally grateful to all lecturers that have played a meaningful role in my academic pursuit.\nLastly, I would like to encourage prospective students with disabilities to never surrender their aspirations in life on the ground of their respective impairments. Disability does not mean inability. Thus, it should not predetermine who you become.\n\t",

These ultra–high-energy cosmic rays bombard earth from time to time, but their source has been a mystery. Now, blazars are a suspect.\nThe IceCube team awaits more fleeting extra-galactic messengers.

This response shows they are committed to building quality, relevant research for Namibia and to making our University globally competitive.  I want research and innovation that will bring wealth to our nation.” SPPU Director, Mr Kennedy Mbangu, heartily thanked his staff for their hard work in getting the message out as to the relevance of this questionnaire. He said, “Strategic and Physical Planning are fully committed to supplying top level business intelligence to UNAM leadership, to enable evidence-based decisions.”\nPhoenix Project lead Professor Judith Hall expressed her delight in assisting UNAM in completing this all important step so successfully, saying “this questionnaire is part of a 4 year change management process designed to make UNAM an African and Global leader in relevant ‘people-centred’ research.”\nFinally, this work is crucial to the development of UNAM as a centre of excellence and this questionnaire will be repeated annually.\n\t",

The Faculty of Science produced the best response rate, while there were also excellent response rates from the Faculties of Economic and Management Sciences, Education, as well as Rundu Campus.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-925\" src=\"http://forumonline.unam.edu.na/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Research-Matters-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"http://forumonline.unam.edu.na/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Research-Matters-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://forumonline.unam.edu.na/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Research-Matters-2-300x200.jpg 300w, http://forumonline.unam.edu.na/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Research-Matters-2-768x512.jpg 768w, http://forumonline.unam.edu.na/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Research-Matters-2-720x480.jpg 720w, http://forumonline.unam.edu.na/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Research-Matters-2-600x400.jpg 600w, http://forumonline.unam.edu.na/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Research-Matters-2.jpg 1350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></p>\n<p>Professor Matengu said, &#x201C;Our staff are engaged and passionate that we do well. This response shows they are committed to building quality, relevant research for Namibia and to making our University globally competitive.&#xA0; I want research and innovation that will bring wealth to our nation.&#x201D; SPPU Director, Mr Kennedy Mbangu, heartily thanked his staff for their hard work in getting the message out as to the relevance of this questionnaire. He said, &#x201C;Strategic and Physical Planning are fully committed to supplying top level business intelligence to UNAM leadership, to enable evidence-based decisions.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Phoenix Project lead Professor Judith Hall expressed her delight in assisting UNAM in completing this all important step so successfully, saying &#x201C;this questionnaire is part of a 4 year change management process designed to make UNAM an African and Global leader in relevant &#x2018;people-centred&#x2019; research.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Finally, this work is crucial to the development of UNAM as a centre of excellence and this questionnaire will be repeated annually.</p>\n\t"

This partnership aims to bring precision medicine to Namibia. Moreover to develop a national genomics initiative, aiming to study the genetic makeup of the Namibian population. Data will then be used to develop relevant precision medicine approaches and build a Centre of Excellence in Genomics in Namibia. This will improve skills and training in this fast-growing area of healthcare research.

Dr Kandjii-Murangi and Dr Naomab (UNAM Southern Campus APVC).\nUNAM representative at the STS Forum, Dr Erold Naomab, the Assistant Pro-Vice Chancellor, at the Southern Campus remarked that “Namibia needs industry savvy academia if we are to compete successfully in the new era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) which is characterized by globalized open innovation”. He was accompanied by the Minister of Higher Education Training and Innovation (MHETI), Hon. Dr. Itah Kandjii-Murangi.\nAccording to Dr Naomab “One of the key objectives of the mission was to engage relevant global Science Technology and Innovation (STI) institutions and networks in order to find synergies that would particularly enhance national efforts to meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including food security and poverty eradication”. The STS forum attracted more than 1400 global leaders from nearly 80 countries. The forum’s Ministers’ Roundtable had more than 25 ministers responsible for Science, Technology and Innovation from around the world.\nUNAM also managed to clinch a partnership with the globally renowned Leibniz Institute for New Materials (INM) based in Saarland, Germany. This project aims to develop new industrial innovations using nanocomposite technologies. The project is expected to produce new types of construction materials, whilst establishing a Material Science Institute in Namibia. Other potential agreements includes agricultural technologies to advance food security, artificial intelligence, cybercrime, robotics and ICT.\n\t",
